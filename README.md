> A modern, mobile-first shopping & packing list app with live sync, store tagging, and smart carry management.


## Features

### 📝 List Management
- Create multiple named lists, each with a custom icon and optional description
- Switch between lists instantly via the collapsible sidebar
- Delete lists with a single confirmation step
- Per-list progress tracked with an animated ring indicator

### 🗂️ Sections
- Organize items within a list into named sections (e.g. "Produce", "Toiletries")
- Collapse/expand sections individually to reduce visual noise
- Delete entire sections (with all their items) in one action
- Live `(done / total)` badge on each section header

### ✅ Items
- Add items to any section via a quick-add input row
- Check off items with an animated checkbox; checked items show with a strikethrough
- Delete individual items via button (desktop) or swipe gesture (mobile)
- Full-text search across all items in the active list

### 🏪 Store Tagging
- Tag any item with one or more stores (e.g. "Carrefour", "IKEA")
- Create new stores inline from the item's store popover — no separate settings page needed
- Stores are assigned auto-generated colors and displayed as colored pills on each item
- Filter the entire list view by store to see only relevant items when you're at a specific shop
- Delete stores globally (removes the tag from all items)

### 🚫 Do Not Carry
- Mark items as "Do Not Carry" to move them to a visually distinct sub-section
- Useful for items that are already packed, not needed this trip, or intentionally excluded
- Restore items back to the carry list with one tap or a swipe action
- **Desktop:** dedicated 🚫 toggle button per row; Mobile: swipe left to reveal actions

### 📱 Mobile-First UX
- Swipeable rows on mobile: swipe left to reveal context-sensitive action buttons
  - On carry items: "Don't Carry" + "Delete"
  - On do-not-carry items: "Restore" + "Delete"
- Direction-locked swipe detection (won't interfere with vertical page scroll)
- Full responsive layout — sidebar slides in as a drawer on small screens
- Larger touch targets on mobile for all interactive elements

### 🔍 Search
- Inline search bar (header on desktop, top of content area on mobile)
- Filters items and sections in real time as you type
- Sections with no matching items are hidden automatically

### 📊 Progress Tracking
- Animated progress bar at the top of the content area
- Per-list progress ring in the sidebar
- Color transitions from amber → green when all items are checked
- `Reset` button to uncheck all items in the active list in one tap

State mutations are handled through named actions exposed by `useAppState`:

| `addItem` | Add a new item to a section |
| `deleteItem` | Remove an item |
| `addSection` | Create a new section in a list |

| `uncheckAll` | Reset all items in a list |
| `addStore` | Create a new store |
| `deleteStore` | Remove a store globally |
| `toggleItemStore` | Add or remove a store tag from an item |

## How access works

This app uses a token-based magic link system.

There is no login page or OAuth flow.

Access is restricted via magic link. Only users with a valid invite URL can view the app.

1. The owner shares a URL in the format `https://yourapp.com/?token=your_access_token`
2. On first visit, the token is validated and stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie
3. Subsequent visits work automatically via the cookie — no token in URL needed
4. Anyone visiting without a valid token sees an **Access Denied** page
5. To revoke access, change `ACCESS_TOKEN` in your environment and redeploy

> **Note:** The `ACCESS_TOKEN` is never exposed to the browser. It lives only in the server environment and is compared server-side in `proxy.ts` before any page is rendered.

## Getting Started

#### Set up env

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=xxxxx
ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxx
```

#### Run server

```bash
# Development

npm install
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## UX Conventions

- **Amber** (`var(--amber)`) — primary accent, active states, in-progress indicators
- **Green** (`var(--green)`) — completion states, restore actions
- **Red** (`var(--red)`) — destructive actions, do-not-carry indicators
- All destructive actions (delete list, section, item, store) require a confirmation dialog
- The app never loses state between navigating lists — all state is kept in memory and synced live
